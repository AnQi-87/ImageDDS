# ImageDDS: A Multi-modal Deep Learning Model for Drug Synergy Prediction Using Image and Graph Representation Learning

## Abstract
In synergistic drug combination therapy, computational screening has become a crucial tool for identifying optimal drug combinations. In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as the primary method for extracting drug features in synergy prediction. However, conventional GNN models still face limitations in capturing complex chemical structures, particularly for cyclic molecules and structures with a large number of atoms. To address these limitations, we propose ImageDDS, a multi-modal deep learning framework designed to improve the structural representation of drug molecules and enhance the predictive accuracy and generalizability of drug synergy modeling. Specifically, we employ a graph Transformer and ResNet18 to extract features from molecular graphs and images, respectively, and fuse these modality-specific features to create a global drug representation. During this process, we further apply contrastive learning to optimize the alignment of graph and image representations, ensuring consistency of features for the same drug across different modalities. Finally, we combine the multi-modal drug features with gene expression embedding from cell lines and feed them into a predictor to identify synergistic drug combinations. In the benchmark dataset, ImageDDS achieves optimal performance under five-fold cross-validation. Furthermore, in the leave-cell line-out setting, the model demonstrated excellent generalization ability, attaining an ROC-AUC of 0.89Â±0.09, representing a 4.7% improvement over the second-best performing model. These results collectively underscore the superior predictive capability and generalizability of ImageDDS across diverse evaluation scenarios.
